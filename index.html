            <p>This is the opening post to this blog. I will be posting about my life, or about the things I'm interested in. This will be things such as programming, or guitar. I will try to post on here daily to the best of my ability.<br><br>August 31, 2024.</p>

            <h1>Second Post</h1>
            <p>Today and last night I've been working my way through the alien series. So far so good. Alien 3 had horrible CGI, though. I have been flipping my butterfly knives and playing my guitar. Not much to complain about. I'm going to FoCo I will report back soon.<br><br>September 1, 2024</p>
